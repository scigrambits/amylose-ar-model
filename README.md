# Amylose Molecule - 3D AR Visualization

## About Amylose

Amylose is a linear polysaccharide composed of α-D-glucose units connected through α(1→4) glycosidic bonds. It is one of the two primary components of starch, typically comprising 20-30% of the starch structure, with amylopectin making up the remainder.

### Molecular Structure

**Chemical Formula**: (C₆H₁₀O₅)ₙ where n ranges from several hundred to several thousand glucose units

**Key Structural Features:**
- **Linear chain**: Unlike amylopectin, amylose has minimal branching
- **Helical conformation**: The polymer naturally forms a helical structure with 6 glucose residues per turn
- **Glycosidic linkage**: α(1→4) bonds connect C1 of one glucose to C4 of the next
- **Hydrophobic interior**: The helix creates a hydrophobic cavity that can accommodate iodine molecules, resulting in the characteristic blue-black color in the iodine-starch test

### Biological Significance

Amylose serves as an important energy storage molecule in plants, particularly in seeds, tubers, and roots. Its linear structure makes it more digestible than highly branched amylopectin, though it is also more resistant to enzymatic breakdown when in its crystalline form (resistant starch).

### Applications

- **Food industry**: Affects texture, digestibility, and gel-forming properties of starch-based foods
- **Bioplastics**: Used in biodegradable packaging materials
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Employed as excipients and in controlled drug delivery systems
- **Industrial uses**: Applied in paper manufacturing, adhesives, and textile processing
